//--NOTES ON VARIABLES
// In C#, variables are defined by their data type rather than general variable keywords like "var" "let" and "const" in JavaScript
// "int" : stores whole number integers without decimals (ex: 150, -637)
// "double" : stores floating point numbers, aka numbers with decimals. (ex: 34.08, -5.23)
// "char" : stores single characters, and the characters (i.e. the data values) are surrounded by single quotes (ex: 'f' or 'Y')
// "string" : stores strings. this one is self explanatory for anyone who is familiar with a programming language. surrounded by double quotes ( "string" or "My name is Paris")
// "bool" : stores booleans, which have two states: true or false.

//--VARIABLE SYNTAX IN C#
// Syntax is the same as with JavaScript and follows this structure:
// type variableName = value;
// ex: int exampleNumber = 5;
